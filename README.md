# Book Search Engine Starter Code
# Description
* This project is a full stack web application using the MERN Stack to allow users to search books using the Google search API. This application demonstrates skill sets used to refractor an original code using REST APIs into GraphQL with Apollo.
# Installation
* The user should clone the repository from GitHub and install dependencies. For development or testing purposes, run npm install on both client and server directories to install dependencies. There are two servers for client side and server side, which can be run on their own. To run both servers at the same time, open the root directory and run npm start.
# Usage
* This application will allow users to search for books and view 10 results. Users are able to sign up and login in. Logged in users can save a book and view a page of saved books. Users can also remove books from their saved page.
* Please view deployed application on https://evening-gorge-74781.herokuapp.com/
